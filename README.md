Tools to help train the donkey car models.

mktraining: generates a synthetic set of images similar to what a rpi camera might capture.
horizontal FOV 60 degrees; resolution 320x240; random confetti on the floor for each image.
Libraries needed to build: GLFW and GLEW.

blur: blur a PNG image based on a mask given in another PNG image.

All of these tools also want "stb" to be a checkout of github.com/nothings/stb as a peer 
to these directories.
